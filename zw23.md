This is your member site. Please leave all anchors like `<!--`, `-->` **as is** in this document. They are used to automatically manage the topics.

1. To create a valid topic, please create `md` or `rmd` files in project directory using the following syntax:
```
zw23-my_topic_name-article_title.md
zw23-my_topic_name-article_title.rmd
```
For example, a file named `bob-2_clustering_method-1_introduction` will gain a topic `2 Clustering Method` with title `1 Introduction` here.

2. To compile your work, simply go to RStudio tabpanel `Build` > press `Build Website`.

3. To automatically manage your topics and add them to this file, run the following commands
```
source('shared/template-utils.R')
collect_user_topics("zw23")
```
