### Pre-requisite

This website is built using `rmarkdown`. Please check the [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) if you don't know how to edit `markdown` files. To add/edit pages, you need `git` to get access to Github and `rmarkdown` installed. Luckily, these can all be found in `RStudio`. 

### Get Started

1. Open RStudio, create project via `File` > `New Project` > `Version Control`
```
File - New Project - Version Control
```
